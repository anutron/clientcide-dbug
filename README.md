How to use
----------

You can leave *dbug.log()* statements in your code and they will not be echoed out to the screen in any way. 

You must enable the logs either by entering "debug.enable()" in your console or by entering "debug.cookie()", which turns it on for the duration of your session.

[See the full documentation for details](http://clientcide.com/docs/Core/dbug).
